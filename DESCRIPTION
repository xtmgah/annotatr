Description: Given a set of genomic sites/regions (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks, CpGs,
    differentially methylated CpGs or regions, SNPs, etc.) it is often of interest
    to investigate the intersecting structural annotations. Such annotations
    include those relating to gene models (promoters, 5'UTRs, exons, introns, and
    3'UTRs), CpGs (CpG islands, CpG shores, CpG shelves), the non-coding genome, and
    enhancers. The annotatr package provides an easy way to summarize and visualize
    the intersection of genomic sites/regions with the above structural annotations.
