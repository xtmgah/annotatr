## annotatr
Associating genomic regions with genomic annotations

### Description
Given a set of genomic sites/regions (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks, CpGs, differentially methylated CpGs or regions, SNPs, etc.) it is often of interest to investigate the intersecting genomic annotations. Such annotations include those relating to gene models (promoters, 5'UTRs, exons, introns, and 3'UTRs) or CpGs (CpG islands, CpG shores, CpG shelves). The `annotatr` package provides an easy way to summarize and visualize the intersection of genomic sites/regions with the above genomic annotations.
