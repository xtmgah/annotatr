CpG islands are taken from the eponymous track in the Regulation group from the corresponding organism in the UCSC Table Browser. CpG shores are defined as flanking 2Kb sequence upstream/downstream of the island boundaries. CpG shelves are defined as flanking 2Kb further upstream/downstream from the CpG shores. InterCGI is the remaining genomic sequence.
