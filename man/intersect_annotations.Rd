\title{A function to intersect user data with annotation data}
\usage{
intersect_annotations(regions, annotations, genome, ignore.strand)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{The GRanges object of the user-data returned by read.bed().}

\item{annotations}{A character vector of annotations to overlap with user-data. Valid annotation codes can be found with supported_annotations(). The "basic_genes" shortcut annotates regions to the 1-5Kb, promoter, 5UTR, CDS, and 3UTR knownGene regions. The "detailed_genes" shortcut annotates regions to the 1-5Kb, promoter, 5UTR exon/intron, CDS exon/intron, and 3UTR exon/intron knownGene regions. The "cpgs" shortcut annotates regions to the CpG islands, shores, shelves, and interCGI regions.}

\item{genome}{One of the genomes in supported_genomes(). Should match argument used in read.bed().}

\item{ignore.strand}{A boolean indicating whether strandedness should be respected in findOverlaps().}
}
\value{
A list of Hits objects giving the indices of objects overlapping in query and subject for each annotation.
}
\description{
Given a GRanges object constructed from user supplied data with read.bed(),
and desired annotation overlaps, use GenomicRanges::findOverlaps() to return a
Hits object indicating which elements of the user-data (query) intersect which
elements of the annotation data (subject).
}
\examples{
bed = system.file('extdata', 'test_intersect.bed', package = 'annotatr')
annotations = c('hg19_cpg_islands','hg19_cpg_shores','hg19_knownGenes_promoters')

d = read_bed(filename = bed, genome = 'hg19', stranded = FALSE)

i = intersect_annotations(
  regions = d,
  annotations = annotations,
  genome = 'hg19',
  ignore.strand = TRUE)
